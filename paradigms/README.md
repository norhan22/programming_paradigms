## Programming paradigms 

### Introduction  :
- The term programming paradigm refers to **a style of programming**
- It does not refer to a specific language, but rather it **refers to the way you program** .
- There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.

### The types :

1. **Imperative** :
  - It is one of the oldest programming paradigm
  - It features close relation to machine architecture
  - It is based on Von Neumann architecture 
    - Von Neumann architecture is based on the stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory.
  - It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. 
  - The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all, the result is stored.

  - **Advantage**:
    
       - Very simple to implement
       - It contains loops, variables etc.
    
  - **Disadvantage**:
    
    - Complex problem cannot be solved
    - Less efficient and less productive
    - Parallel programming is not possible
---
  - Imperative programming is divided into three broad categories: Procedural, OOP and parallel processing.

2. **Declarative** :
   - It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database.
